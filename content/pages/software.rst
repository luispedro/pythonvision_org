Essential Software
..................

1. Python. Use version 2.6 or 2.7, if you are new to python.
2. ``numpy``

If you are using Linux, you should use the packages that come with your
distribution.

On Windows, use `WinPython <http://code.google.com/p/winpython/>`__

If you are using Mac OS, check out `Enthought's Python Distribution
<http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php>`_ as a good solution
if you are not very familiar with how to install Unix-style software. It
includes all of the packages above.

Recommended Software
....................

1. `ipython <http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/>`__
2. `pymorph <http://luispedro.org/software/pymorph>`__: Basic (and not so basic)
   image morphological operators.
3. `scikit-image <http://scikit-image.org>`__: A collection of algorithms in Python and Cython
4. `mahotas <http://luispedro.org/software/mahotas>`_: Several algorithms in
   fast C++
5. `simpleCV <http://www.simplecv.org/>`__: Computer vision library.

Other Software
..............

Machine Learning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Often computer vision uses machine learning at its core. Some machine learning
packages did it all, but it is better software engineering to keep these
separate.

1. `scikit.learn <http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net/>`_
2. `milk <http://luispedro.org/software/milk>`_
3. `pymvpa <http://www.pymvpa.org>`_
